Takeaway
Dark psychology looks into how people use their understanding of human behavior and emotions to control others. It includes tactics like guilt-tripping, gaslighting, and reverse psychology.

Have you ever met someone who seems to effortlessly handle social situations and understand emotions? People with high emotional intelligence (EI) have these skills, using them to empathize, adapt to different social settings, and solve conflicts peacefully.

But these skills can also be used for darker purposes. Dark psychology looks at how people with traits like Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism might manipulate others using their understanding of emotions and social dynamics.

Let’s take a closer look at these manipulation tactics.


What is dark psychology?
Dark psychology refers to the study and application of psychological principles to manipulate, influence, or control people in harmful ways. It explores how individuals use tactics such as manipulation, coercion, and deception to achieve their goals at the expense of others.

Dark psychology techniques
Manipulation
Manipulation is an umbrella term for many of the techniques listed here. It involves cleverly or deceptively influencing or controlling someone, often at their expense, using tactics like:

persuasion
deception
coercion
It can occur in various contexts, such as personal relationships or work environments. Manipulation often exploits emotions, vulnerabilities, or beliefs to achieve goals.

Paltering
Paltering is a deceptive tactic where someone tells the truth but conceals important information, creating a false or misleading impression. For instance, imagine a person on a first date who says, “I’m really open and honest in my relationships. My last partner and I even shared our social media passwords.”

This may seem like an honest revelation, but the person fails to mention that their previous relationship was marked by distrust and jealousy, leading to the sharing of passwords to monitor each other’s activities.

By offering this information unprompted, the person attempts to appear honest and open while hiding the negative aspects of their past relationship.

Gaslighting
Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where a person makes someone doubt their perceptions or sanity by denying the truth or altering reality.

In a relationship, this can involve one partner repeatedly telling the other, “You’re imagining things” or “That didn’t happen like that,” leading to self-doubt.

Over time, the victim may begin to doubt themselves and their version of reality, believing they’re the problem in the relationship.

A studyTrusted Source of 65 individuals who experienced gaslighting found that it often occurs alongside both loving and abusive behaviors. This often resulted in a diminished sense of self and mistrust of others, though some experienced personal growth after recovery.

Backstabbing
Backstabbing refers to the act of betraying someone’s trust or confidence by secretly harming or undermining them, especially after pretending to be their friend or ally. It involves deception and betrayal, often for personal gain or to harm the other person.

For instance, Alex wants a promotion and sees Chris as a rival. Alex pretends to be supportive of Chris while secretly working to discredit him — spreading false rumors and taking credit for his work — all to boost his own chances of getting promoted.

Triangulation
Triangulation is a manipulation tactic where a person involves a third party to manipulate or control a situation, often by creating competition, jealousy, or insecurity.

For example, Allie feels jealous of Bracy’s new friendship with Carol. Instead of addressing her feelings directly with Bracy or finding ways to cope, Allie may start making negative comments about Carol to Bracy.

This behavior can create tension between Bracy and Carol, as Bracy may feel torn between her new friendship and her existing ones.

Exploitation
Exploitation involves identifying and taking advantage of someone’s weaknesses, insecurities, or fears to manipulate them. This can include emotional, psychological, or physical vulnerabilities.

An example could be a scam artist exploiting an elderly person’s loneliness and desire for companionship by pretending to befriend them, only to then manipulate them into giving them money.

Guilt-tripping
Guilt tripping is a manipulative tactic where someone tries to make another person feel guilty to control their behavior. It often involves emotional manipulation to make the person feel responsible for something that’s not their fault or to exaggerate the impact of their actions on others.

For instance, a friend might guilt trip you by saying, “I thought you cared about me, but I guess I was wrong.” This statement is designed to make you feel guilty for not meeting their expectations, even if those expectations are unreasonable or unfair.

Reverse psychology
Reverse psychology is a strategy where someone encourages another person to do something by suggesting they do the opposite, tapping into their desire for autonomy or defiance against being manipulated.

For example, if one partner wants the other to spend more time with them, they might say, “You probably wouldn’t want to spend time with me anyway, so go ahead and hang out with your friends.”

This could trigger the other person’s desire to prove them wrong and result in them canceling their plans to be with their partner, even though it’s not what they truly want.

Love bombing
Love bombing is a manipulative tactic used to gain someone’s affection or trust by overwhelming them with attention, compliments, and praise. This creates a strong emotional bond that can be used to manipulate or control the person.

For example, in a romantic relationship, a person might use love bombing to quickly win over their partner by showering them with gifts and affection. This intense display of affection can make the target feel special and loved, but it’s often done with the intention of gaining control over them.

Negging
Negging is a manipulative tactic used in dating or social interactions to undermine someone’s confidence, making them seek validation or approval from the person using the tactic. It often involves giving backhanded compliments or mild insults disguised as compliments.

For example, someone might use negging by saying to a person they’re interested in, “You’re pretty cute for someone who doesn’t take care of themselves.” This statement subtly insults the person’s appearance, making them feel insecure and seek approval.

The Dark Psychology Triad
The dark psychology triad is a term that refers to three personality traits that are associated with malicious and manipulative behaviors. These three traits are:

1. Narcissism

Narcissism is a personality trait characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a lack of empathy for others, and a need for admiration and validation. Narcissists may believe that they are special and entitled to special treatment, and they may have a sense of entitlement that leads them to exploit or mistreat others to achieve their goals. Narcissists may also be prone to envy, arrogance, and resentment.

2. Machiavellianism

Machiavellianism is a personality trait named after the Italian Renaissance politician Niccolo Machiavelli, who was known for his cunning and deceitful political strategies. It refers to a set of personality traits believed to be associated with manipulative and deceptive behaviors. Individuals high in Machiavellianism are often manipulative, and strategic and are skilled at navigating social situations to their advantage.

3. Psychopathy

Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of remorse, empathy, and conscience. Psychopaths tend to have a superficial charm and high impulsivity. They may exhibit antisocial, aggressive, and violent behaviors without regard for the consequences. Psychopaths may also be irresponsible, parasitic, and callous.

Benefits of dark psychology
1. Increased awareness and understanding of human nature and behavior, especially the darker aspects that are often hidden or ignored.

2. Improved ability to detect and defend against deception, manipulation, or coercion by others, and to protect oneself from harm or exploitation.

3. Enhanced skills and competencies in various domains that require psychological knowledge and insight, such as law enforcement, security, or education.

4. Dark psychology helps us understand why people do the things they do.

Harmful Effects of Dark Psychology
While dark psychology can be fascinating and intriguing, it can also have harmful effects on individuals and society.

1. It can erode trust and relationships: People who use dark psychology techniques such as lying, gaslighting, or emotional manipulation can damage the trust and bond they have with others. They can make others doubt their reality, feelings, and judgments, and create a sense of confusion and insecurity. This can lead to emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem in the victims of dark psychology.

2. It can impair decision-making and rationality: People who are exposed to dark psychology tactics such as propaganda, misinformation, or persuasion can be influenced to act against their own best interests or values. They can be swayed by emotional appeals, false promises, or fear-mongering, and lose their ability to think critically and independently. This can result in poor choices, regret, or guilt in the victims of dark psychology.

3. It can increase aggression and violence: People who practice dark psychology may have a lack of empathy, remorse, or conscience for their actions. They may view others as objects or tools to be used for their own gain, and disregard their rights or feelings. They may also have a sense of entitlement, superiority, or narcissism that makes them feel justified in harming others. This can lead to antisocial behavior, criminal activity, or even homicide in the perpetrators of dark psychology.

Most people are familiar with the concept of psychology, which is the study of human behavior.

However, fewer people are aware of dark psychology, which is a branch of psychology that deals with manipulation and persuasion.

It’s a topic that is shrouded in mystery and misunderstanding, covering the darker aspects of human nature, such as manipulation, mind control, and persuasion. This field of study can be extremely fascinating, but it can also be quite disturbing.

In this guide, we will explore all facets of dark psychology and answer some common questions about it, while analyzing examples of the practice in action.

What is dark psychology?
Dark psychology is the application of manipulation, persuasion, and coercion in a way that may harm the recipient.

More commonly, dark psychology may be referred to as psychological or emotional abuse and manipulation.

Psychological abuse
Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics.

By preying on people’s vulnerabilities and weaknesses, manipulators can subtly encourage them to do things that they wouldn’t normally do. 

Is dark psychology real?
Absolutely. Although it might not always be labeled dark psychology, psychological manipulation is a sad reality.

If you’re anything like me, you’re quite attuned to dark psychologists and how they play their power games.

If not, you’re in the right place, because we’ll investigate some examples of how it’s used, so you can protect yourself against its wiley ways.

Facts and stats
Unfortunately, dark psychology in the context of abuse is a prevalent societal problem and is a common form of Intimate Partner Violence.

Indeed, the WHO estimates that the lifetime prevalence of emotional IPV among women could range from 20-75%.

In this survey, it was found that 57% of respondents felt uncomfortable or afraid in their current relationship, increasing to 87% for previous relationships. Furthermore, nearly 50% of men and women reported some form of psychological aggression.

And it’s not just restricted to adults. This UK research estimated that 1 in 11 adults had experienced emotional abuse before the age of 16 (3.8 million people).

Examples
While dark psychology can be used for malicious purposes, it mustn’t be confused with persuasion, which can be employed for more mundane goals, such as sales or marketing. Sometimes, however, this line may be blurred.

Examples of dark psychology can be seen across all aspects of life. While it’s arguably more common in romantic relationships as the research above demonstrates, you might also notice its use elsewhere. This could include:

A friend uses suggestive techniques to persuade you to do something
A power play at work, where a colleague engages in oneupmanship
Here are additional examples of it in action:

anxious-man-sitting-on-bed
1. Persuasive speech
Manipulative speakers often use dark psychology techniques to convince their audience to do something, whether it’s buying a product, voting for a candidate, or supporting a cause. Such (“dark”) persuasion often relies on emotional appeal and logical fallacies to make its case, rather than sound reasoning.

2. Deceptive advertising
Ads that rely on false claims or misleading images are employing dark psychology to encourage people to take action, which may or may not be in their best interests. One amazing book on this topic is by the grandaddy of persuasion research, Robert Cialdini – compulsory reading for anyone interested in this topic.

3. Coercive interrogation
This is a controversial technique employed by law enforcement and intelligence agencies in which suspects are subjected to psychological pressure in order to elicit information. While this practice has been shown to be effective in some cases, it is also considered unethical by many.

4. Mind control
This is perhaps the most extreme example of dark psychology, in which an individual or group seeks to control another. Often you might see this in the case of cult leaders, who are enigmatic enough to convince their followers to do their every bidding.

How do people use dark psychology?
Many practitioners of dark psychology use it to gain power for personal or professional gain. Here are 5 common techniques.

1. Gaining trust through love bombing
Love bombing is a form of psychological manipulation in which an individual deliberately uses flattery, gifts, and attention to gain control over another person. Although it is often used in relationships, it can also occur in friendships, family relationships, and work environments. Love bombers typically display excessive amounts of affection and attention early on in the relationship in order to create an intense bond. They may also make grand promises or give lavish gifts in order to further their control. Over time, the love bomber may begin to withdraw their support and instead use criticism, and emotional control to maintain power.

2. Gaslighting
Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse in which the abuser deliberately tries to undermine the victim’s sense of reality. It is an insidious form of control that can have a devastating effect on the victim’s mental health. Gaslighting usually starts gradually, with the abuser making small changes to the victim’s environment or routine. The aim is to create confusion and doubt in the victim’s mind so that they second-guess their own memories and perceptions. Over time, the victim may start to doubt their own sanity. If you suspect that you’re being exposed to these techniques, it is important to seek help from a trusted friend or professional.

3. Passive-aggressive behavior
Passive-aggressive psychological manipulation is a type of emotional manipulation that can be difficult to spot because it often masquerades as normal behavior. Passive-aggressive manipulators may seem withdrawn or uninterested, but in reality, they are carefully monitoring your reaction to their behavior. They may withhold information or make snide comments in an attempt to get you to react. If you suspect that someone is trying to manipulate you emotionally, it is essential to pay attention to your gut feelings and take steps to protect yourself. You may need to set boundaries or build a support network of people you can trust. Remember, you are not responsible for the manipulator’s happiness, and you should not let them control your emotions.

4. Emotional blackmail
Emotional blackmail is a powerful psychological manipulation tool that can be used to control and exploit others. It usually involves the threat of withholding love or approval unless the victim complies with the blackmailer’s demands. Often, emotional blackmailers will use guilt or fear to induce their victims to do what they want. For example, a parent might threaten to withdraw their love if their child does not obey them, causing damage to relationships and emotional distress.

5. Withdrawing affection
One common manipulation tactic is withdrawing affection, which often accompanies emotional blackmail. This can take many forms, from refusing to speak to someone to withholding physical affection, and it is often used in order to punish someone or force them into doing something. Withdrawing affection can be an incredibly powerful tool, as it taps into our deep-seated need for connection and approval. When we’re cut off from those things, it can cause us a great deal of distress. In some cases, the pain of being disconnected from another person can be enough to motivate them to change their behavior. While withdrawing affection may get results in the short term, it is not a healthy way to interact with others in the long term, causing lasting emotional damage.
